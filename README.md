## Description

Our country is constantly being attacked by unknown armed gunmen.
They kill our citizens. We need help!
We need a command ship to protect our citizens. 
The goal is to eliminate all of the gunmen by shooting them. The gunmen attempt to destroy the player by firing projectiles(lasers).
player is given the ability to fire lasers at moving enemies.
Game over is triggered by the enemies killing the player by getting hit by lasers from unknown gunmen (either by getting hit by lasers or enemies ) rather than simply a timer running out.
